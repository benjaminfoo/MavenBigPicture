Maven - The big picture
===============

This is an overview of the features that the build management software Apache Maven (3.x) offers. I created this over the last half year in order to fill in those documentation gaps which a lot of my co-workers had to struggle with while getting started with maven. The original file was created with the well known mindmapping tool "free mind".

P.S.: The most of the content is copied straight from the internet, but I've referenced those sources as shortcuts within the map. It's a collaboration from sites like Stackoverflow, the Apache Maven wiki and the places google led me into.
